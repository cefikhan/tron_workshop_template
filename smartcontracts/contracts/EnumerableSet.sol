/** 
 *   Set struct: It stores the values of the set in the _values array and maintains a mapping _indexes to track the position of each value in the array.

    _add function: It adds a value to the set if it's not already present. It appends the value to the _values array and updates the _indexes mapping accordingly.

    _remove function: It removes a value from the set if it exists. It swaps the value with the last value in the _values array and updates the _indexes mapping. Then it removes the last value from the array.

    _contains function: It checks if a value is present in the set by looking up its index in the _indexes mapping.

    _length function: It returns the number of values in the set by returning the length of the _values array.

    _at function: It retrieves the value at a specific index in the set by accessing the corresponding position in the _values array.

    _values function: It returns the entire set as an array by returning the _values array.

    Bytes32Set, AddressSet, and UintSet structs: They are wrapper structs around the generic Set struct, specialized for storing bytes32 values, address values, and uint256 values, respectively.

    add, remove, contains, length, at, and values functions: These functions provide a user-friendly interface for working with sets of specific types (bytes32, address, uint256) by internally calling the corresponding functions on the underlying Set struct.
